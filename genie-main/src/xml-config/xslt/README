This dir contains the schemas developed in Bristol for the default/vanilla/definition file
(GENIE_definition.xsd) and config/user files (GENIE_config.xsd).
There is also an XSLT file for merging instances of these two filetypes along with 
example instance documents. The tmp.xml file is an example of the merged output.

To perform the merge, e.g.:
xsltproc -stringparam user_xml genie_example_config.xml merge.xsl genie_example_def.xml

To validate instance documents, e.g.:
xmllint --noout --schema GENIE_definition.xsd genie_example_def.xml

xsltproc is part of libxslt and xmllint is part of libxml; see xmlsoft.org.
It may be possible to bundle these utilities with genie...?
Another handy utility is xmlindent: xmlindent.sourceforge.net.
