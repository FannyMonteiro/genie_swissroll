Filelists.

These filelists allow the creation of 'standalone' experiments by listing the
data input files (boundary conditions, topography etc) stored in the genie
source tree, which are required for a model run, allowing build_experiment.sh to
copy them into the experiment directory (e.g.
genie/genie-experiments/my_experiment/). File lists ate likely to be pretty
standard for a particular setup of experiment, so these should be explicitly
named and stored in this directory.  MJ 21/05/09
